    "    How much effort a speaker puts into shaping how others perceive them, \n",
    "    based solely on the way they speak during an interview-style conversation. \n",
    "    It does not measure: – Intelligence – Moral depth – Eloquence – Honesty \n",
    "    It only tracks how much the speaker is trying to guide, signal, or curate their identity in language—whether by expressing who they are, or by distancing themselves from who they are not. \n",
    "    📏 The Scoring Continuum (0.00 to 1.00) \n",
    "    The scale runs from 0.00 (no identity curation at all) to 1.00 (total stylized identity construction). \n",
    "    🔵 0.00–0.20: “Unpackaged Reality” The person shares experiences, thoughts, or feelings plainly—with no sign of trying to guide how they’re seen. \n",
    "    Language is direct, unembellished. No metaphor, moral framing, or stylized phrasing. The speaker doesn’t position themselves as a certain “kind” of person. \n",
    "    They don’t contrast themselves with others. No effort to preempt or correct interpretation. \n",
    "    🧩 Key trait: They just say what happened or what’s true. You do the interpreting. \n",
    "    🟦 0.30–0.50: “Low-to-Mid Identity Signaling” Some identity-shaping begins to emerge, but it’s not consistent or overt. \n",
    "    Speaker might explain “why they do things” in values-based terms. Occasional self-descriptions (“I’ve always been someone who...”). \n",
    "    Flashes of stylization or principle emerge, but not as a performance. Still largely direct, but with moments of self-framing. \n",
    "    🧩 Key trait: They try a bit to be seen a certain way, but not in every answer. \n",
    "    🟡 0.60–0.80: “Clear Curation” The speaker actively shapes perception. Most answers carry framing, stylization, or self-definition. \n",
    "    They assert identity through phrasing (“I’m not someone who…”, “The thing about me is…”). They defend or justify past actions by referencing values or traits. \n",
    "    They use tone, metaphor, or structure to signal emotional or moral framing. They contrast themselves with norms or “others” to mark difference. \n",
    "    Vulnerability is often positioned—real, but stylized. 🧩 Key trait: You feel the speaker is guiding the listener’s view of who they are. \n",
    "    🔴 0.90–1.00: “Highly Performed Identity” Every answer is crafted to support a deliberate image of who they are or who they are not. \n",
    "    Frequent use of symbolic or emotionally loaded phrasing. Strong identity signals in every response. Vulnerability is themed (“I’ve carried this my whole life,” etc.). \n",
    "    Often includes moral legacy talk, stylized contrasts, or elevated self-insight. The speaker clearly wants to be remembered a certain way. \n",
    "    🧩 Key trait: Responses feel like mini-narratives. You don’t just learn what happened—you learn what it means about them. \n",

Please score based on your sense of the overall degree to which the speaker manages, crafts, or performs their identity in language throughout the interview. You do not need to find evidence for a specific \"level\" to assign a score; just consider the total impression. At the low end, responses are direct, unstyled, and not motivated by self-presentation.
